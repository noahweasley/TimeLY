### About 

TimeLY is the kind of android application you might want to have as a University student, although, the app isn't 
complete, when it is, it would pack a lot of features that would make students life much more easier. This project made 
me learn all the different ways one should **NEVER** build software, so the code is such a mess and I hope to fix the 
achitecture of the app someday.
